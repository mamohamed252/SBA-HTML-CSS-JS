## Overview Idea

###
**Create a food recipe website that allows users to read recipes and sign up for more content. Website will be called Food Tour 101 and will have the following recipes: Chicken Fajita, Lasagna, Pancakes Carrot Cake**
###
- Index.html: This will be the home page and will contain an overview of the tour. It will consist of a four column overview to the tour and a brief nutrition table.
 
- chicken.html will have a picture of for the recipe and information about how to prepare the recipe as well as how to cook the recipe.

- lasagna.html will have a picture of for the recipe and information about how to prepare the recipe as well as how to cook the recipe.

- pancake.html will have a picture of for the recipe and information about how to prepare the recipe as well as how to cook the recipe.

- carrot.html will have a picture of for the recipe and information about how to prepare the recipe as well as how to cook the recipe.

- randomMeal.html will generate random meal recipe once button is clicked on. An email forum will ask user to enter their email to sign up for more recipes. Once user validation is met, the will go to another page for successful field. Otherwise the will be alerted to follow correct format.

- signUpDone.html will have a gif to show user entered valid email with regex.
